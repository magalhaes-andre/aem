# AEM - Playground

This is a very simple repository, built with:
- [AEM Archetype](https://github.com/adobe/aem-project-archetype)
- [AEM Component Generator](https://github.com/adobe/aem-component-generator)

Archetype definitions used can be found in [archetype.properties](./archetype.properties)

## Components to use with Component Generator

All the components delivered in this project are stored under [generator-configs](./generator-configs) folder. The idea is to run the component generator jar, pointing into any of the .jsons available in that folder
